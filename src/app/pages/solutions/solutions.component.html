              <p>Your software needs periodic upgrading or updating in order to keep it current and to ensure that it
                still
                serves its purpose. Internet technologies, as we know it, are constantly improving and your business
                process
                should be able to keep up with these changes. To keep your system efficient and accurate is what
                upgrades
                and
                updates are all about.</p>

              <p>Whether you want to upgrade your website or a stand-alone business application (for both desktop and
                mobile)
                to the latest standards - in whatever industry you belong - you can rest assured that the software
                development
                team at Agents of Value will find ways to deliver the right upgrades that you need.</p>

              <p>Agents of Value also understands that your current software might still be useful and just needs some
                fixes
                to
                keep it accurate and efficient. With this, we may recommend updating - e.g. fixing bugs, making
                third-party
                integrations current and compatible - instead of building a new and upgraded system for your business.
                This
                way, you can save more from system development costs.</p>

              <p>Agents of Value considers all factors before making any recommendation as to whether your best course
                of
                action is to go for an upgrade or an update. And, of course, we recognize the importance of your input
                so we
                make sure that you are involved in the development process of your project.</p>

              <p>Need help to update or upgrade your software for optimum business performance? We’re excited to hear
                more
                about it. We could be of help.</p>

              <p>Data are useless without transforming them into meaningful information. You have to put them together
                and
                analyze how one relates the other in order to make an intelligent business decision. And the key to
                doing
                that is effective organization.</p>

              <p>A simple system that organizes a list of products according to prices, number of good reviews, or date
                of
                release can make a big difference in the performance of your business. Effective organization is
                synonymous
                to efficiency. Efficiency, coupled with accuracy, can drastically improve your business process,
                resulting
                in higher return on investment.</p>

              <p>For more than a decade as a tech solutions provider to clients across the spectrum of industries, we
                have
                proven that by simply providing a company with custom-designed organizational tools, it results to the
                increase in business performance - both in production and sales - and, finally, better ROI.</p>

                an

              <p>In business, be it traditional or digital, every moment counts. For instance, a few minutes of system
                downtime for an e-commerce website can have a drastic drop in sales. What more if it is disconnected to
                the
                network for an hour or two? Or even longer? What you need is a team that is readily available to address
                such
                troubleshooting issues - and address them promptly.</p>

              <p> One of the most common problems that our clients face while running their business is their inability
                to
                fix
                website bugs on their own. Issues like plugins incompatibility, database errors, third-party integration
                errors involving payment system, POS software mismatch, and the like. If you are having the same (or
                similar)
                issue in your current process, Agents of Value might be the most qualified team to address that.</p>
